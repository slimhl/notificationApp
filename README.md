# notificationApp

The project is not completed, i supposed that all informations are mandatory so i didn't handle null cases.
For the sending services i supposed that we are using external provider  so i prepared only the method signature.

To run the project:
 1. clone or download the project 
 2. import the project to your IDE (Intellij ...)
 3. run the NotificationServiceTest to see the notification generation process
